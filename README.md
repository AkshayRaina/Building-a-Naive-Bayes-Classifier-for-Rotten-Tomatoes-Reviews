Building a Naive Bayes Classifier for Rotten Tomatoes Reviews

I have created Naive Bayes Classifier for rotten tomatoes reviews from the dataset from Kaggle available shared below, calculated accuracies and determined whether reviews are rotten or fresh etc.

Data Set used:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/rotten-tomatoes-reviews 

Please follow below steps to run the Jupyter notebook:

Download the Notebook from the Github repository.
Open Google colab Go to File -> Open Notebook Select the Assignment2.ipynb notebook.
Once you are able to view the notebook, run the first couple of cells to import dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/rotten-tomatoes-reviews into the Google Colab workspace. Then continue running the notebook to see the code running and view as per the blog.
